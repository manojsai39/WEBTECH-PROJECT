                <p id="newsaha"> 100% Telugu OTT entertainment app Aha has been making all the right noises recently.
                    Along with
                    acquiring hit content and releasing exclusive talk shows and movies, Aha has been focusing on
                    increasing it’s base outside India as well.

                    As an extension to this, Aha is adding many films exclusively for people outside India. Recent
                    blockbuster of Power Star Pawan Kalyan will start streaming on Aha for people outside India from
                    tomorrow. Other excellent titles like Sarileru Neekevvaru, Jaanu, V, Nishabdham and Falaknuma Das
                    are also being added to the already existing library of 30 odd exclusive overseas streaming films.

                    Team Aha seems to have struck the right formula with respect to positioning of it’s app.</p>

                <p id="newsaha"> Superstar Mahesh Babu, who usually shoots for one film at a once, has decided to break
                    the rule for SSMB28. Given the pandemic time, Mahesh has decided to up his pace and work on two
                    films at once after the Covid-19 gets controlled and shootings begin. Mahesh wants to shoot for
                    Sarkaru Vaari Paata and SSMB28 with Trivikram simultaneously i.e one schedule after the other
                    schedule and vice versa.
